intlexchange-intlcamps-content-1-1=The EDPHY camp was created in 1965, and it is a professional camp certified by the Quebec Minister of Education and the Quebec Camp Association has a long history of 52 years. The camp is international because it welcomes students from around the world who come to participate in the summer camp each year.
intlexchange-intlcamps-content-1-2=EDPHY has two camps, one is Val Morin camp and the other is Saint Lucia camp. Normally, Chinese students live in the Val Morin camp, but they often need to go to the Saint Lucia camp to participate in the hydrobases.
intlexchange-intlcamps-content-1-3=EDPHY is located in a 590-acre forest with a private lake that links with Rivière-du-Nord. The camp has its own facilities and a physical education park.

aboutus-section-history-content-2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"San Jia" represents the educational philosophy of cultivating students' all-round development of morality and intelligence. "San Jia" has entered the eighth year as a brand in Montreal.
aboutus-section-history-content-3=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jia Chinese School was established in 2010.
aboutus-section-history-content-4=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the establishment of Sanjia Club in 2011, various cultural events were held from time to time, and the style of Chinese culture promotion in Mengcheng was created with \u201CGuo Feng Ya Ji\u201D.
aboutus-section-history-content-5=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013, Sanjia School will relocate to the new campus to meet the needs of more students. The new campus has a beautiful environment, close to the subway station villa maria, convenient transportation, and free parking on campus.
aboutus-section-history-content-6=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013, commissioned by the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Montreal, the three best teachers and students performed tea art, Tai Chi and guzheng performances at the World Culture Week Chinese Culture Week. In the same year, the 31-string band founded by the teacher of the Three Arts Department won the second prize of the Montreal Multicultural Festival. In 2013, the first Sanjia Cup Photography Competition was also held.
aboutus-section-history-content-7=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014, the San Jia School hosted the Chinese New Year Gala for local French schools by representing Chinese people in Montreal. In the same year, after having obtained the delegation of the representative of the admission of the China region of the school boards of Quebec, a program was begun to study to the foreign countries. We accepted the invitation from the Shandong Office of Chinese Affairs overseas in a month, and we organized the first "Shandong trip" for children of Chinese descent. We are doing our utmost to promote and develop Chinese culture in Quebec.
aboutus-section-history-content-8=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2014, the three teachers and students will be invited by the Montreal City Library to host the Chinese Traditional Culture Month and hold lectures and performances in English and French.
aboutus-section-history-content-9=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"San Jia" continues to innovate and move forward to have a greater societal impact in the future.
aboutus-section-history-content-10=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is important in the development of a race. How to let children of Chinese descent in North America blend into the local society and know their own cultures and stories, strengthen the pride and confidence of the Chinese race at the same time was an important topic for "San Jia" when our school had just started. To study the Chinese language well is the best way. Between 2014 and 2015, "San Jia" popularized the teaching of Chinese. We will add the investment and reduce the tuition fee to a minimum of $ 155 (annual) and give the scholarship to the best students to activate their enthusiasm. We will strengthen our teaching resources, train our teachers together with the remote elementary school in Shandong, promote the latest methods of Chinese education and make plans in detail. We will establish cooperation with public welfare libraries in China to organize a storymaking selection activity. We will spread the reading of the pictorial history books, cultivate them a good habit of reading that they can be benefited for all the life. Children are able to raise their levels of Chinese and learn knowledge about Chinese culture without them noticing, and they can learn more Chinese characters through reading too. In addition, San Jia strives to employ professors known to establish a good brand. For example, the Department of Physical Education has as a teacher of Chinese martial art who comes from the Hao Ran School of Physical Education and former Taichi Champion of Jiangxi Province, Professor Wang Professor of Chess , Mr. Jiang Wei, the table tennis club and the Chinese football team. The art department has not only the band of 31 strings, but also guzheng, guitar, electronic piano, choir, painting, calligraphy and Chinese dance classes that have adopted dance for children from the Phoenix School. The San Jia club has a lot of rich and varied activities.
aboutus-section-history-content-11=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015, we will start an international language school by cooperating with the francophone school board, all levels of English, French and Chinese classes are included.

We dream of offering a richer spirit to children and lead them to a more constant and more confident life.
