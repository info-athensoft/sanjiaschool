<br/>
In the winters of Montreal, there's almost absolutely no construction happening and if there was any, it would be building houses, shops, towers …etc. This season is normally the season off road destruction because in order to keep snow from growing too high, people put salt on the roads to melt snow. Melting snow is good, but the salt also has a side effect; it destroys the roads. This is the reason of why in the summer and fall, there’s so many roads closing for construction.</p>
