<h1>Summer</h1>

<p>
For normal people, summer is like: Summer time! "Let's have fun!" , but for many construction workers, it’s more like :"time to work!", so that means heavy construction in Montreal so it results in pretty heavy traffic and if you want a visual, here it is.

As you can now see, that’s a lot of traffic. Still, keep in mind that you should know that all the things can change overtime, so in order to be completely aware, some research for yourself would be good.

Most of the construction happening in the summer is on the road, because of the reason that roads must be in good condition for the following winter and to recover from the past winter. In order to avoid getting in traffic, or being late for something because that the road you normally take is under construction, you should check out my <a href="">tips book</a>.</p>
